# Edit customize.sh as you wish to customize squid.conf.
# It will not be overwritten by upgrades.
# See customhelps.awk for information on predefined edit functions.
# In order to test changes to this, run this to regenerate squid.conf:
#       service frontier-squid
# and to reload the changes into a running squid use
#       service frontier-squid reload
# Avoid single quotes in the awk source or you have to protect them from bash.
